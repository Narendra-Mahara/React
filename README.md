# Learning React with Vite

## Introduction
I am currently learning **React**  using **Vite** as the build tool to streamline the development process. This project serves as a playground for me to experiment with React concepts and Vite's fast and optimized bundling features.

## Why React with Vite?
- **React** is one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces.
- **Vite** is a next-generation build tool that significantly improves development speed by leveraging native ES modules and offering fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement).

Together, React and Vite make the development process smoother and more enjoyable by providing fast builds, efficient updates, and a developer-friendly environment.

## Key Features of Vite
- **Instant server start**: Vite starts a local development server quickly, so I can start coding right away.
- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: Any changes made in the code reflect immediately in the browser without a full reload.
- **Optimized build**: Vite uses Rollup under the hood to create optimized production builds, perfect for deploying React applications.
