# axios

### axios is a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and node.js. It is a popular library that allows you to make HTTP requests to servers from your web application. It is better than fetch because it has a simpler syntax and provides more features like interceptors, cancellation, and error handling. In this example, we are using axios to fetch data from a public API and display it in a card format.
