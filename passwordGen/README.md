# Password Generator App

This is a simple password generator web application built using React. It allows users to generate a random password with various options and easily copy the password to the clipboard.

## Features

- **Password Length**: The user can adjust the password length using a range slider (from 8 to 20 characters).
- **Uppercase Letters**: Option to include or exclude uppercase letters.
- **Numbers**: Option to include or exclude numbers.
- **Special Characters**: Option to include or exclude special characters (e.g., `!@#$%^&*()_+`).
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Users can click the "copy" button to copy the generated password to the clipboard.

## How to Use

1. **Adjust Settings**: Use the sliders and checkboxes to select your password preferences:
   - Choose the password length.
   - Select whether to include uppercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters.
2. **Generate Password**: Click the **Generate** button to generate a random password based on the selected settings.
3. **Copy Password**: Once the password is generated, click the **copy** button to copy the password to the clipboard.

## Code Structure

- **React Hooks**: The app utilizes the `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef` hooks to manage state and handle side effects.

  - `useState`: Manages the password length, inclusion of uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters, and the password itself.
  - `useEffect`: Generates a new password every time the "Generate" button is clicked.
  - `useRef`: Provides a reference to the password input field for easy text selection and copying.

- **Password Generation Logic**: The password is generated by dynamically building a character set based on the selected options, then randomly picking characters to form the password.
